# Portable Spectrometer for Non-Invasive Sugar Content Detection in fruits Using Near-Infrared Spectrometry(NIRS)


A brief description of what this project does and who it's for.

This project explores the development of a portable spectrometer designed to evaluate the quality of fruits through non-invasive techniques. Leveraging the AS7265x sensor's multispectral capabilities, the project focuses on assessing key parameters such as sugar content (TSS), size, color, and acidityâ€”essential factors for optimizing harvest timing and ensuring product quality.

Traditionally, measuring sugar content in fruits involves labor-intensive methods like UV absorption and refractometry, which can be both time-consuming and potentially damaging to the fruit. Our approach utilizes near-infrared (NIR) spectrometry, which offers a non-destructive alternative for accurate quality assessment.

The core of the project involves integrating the AS7265x sensor with advanced machine learning algorithms to enhance the accuracy and affordability of the evaluation process. We employ algorithms such as Backpropagation Neural Networks (BPNN), Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), and Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) to analyze sensor data and determine the sugar content in fruits.

By developing this portable spectrometer, our goal is to provide an efficient, user-friendly solution for the agricultural industry to improve harvesting practices, ensure better fruit quality, and increase consumer satisfaction.
